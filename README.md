Project Title: Sentiment Analysis

Project Goal:
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of product reviews using deep learning techniques. The analysis focuses on differentiating between positive and negative sentiments in text data.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Deep Learning Models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Dataset
The dataset consists of text reviews organized into two folders: positive and negative reviews. The training set includes files numbered 0-699, while the testing set contains files numbered 700-999.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the analysis of sentiment in text reviews using various deep learning architectures, showcasing their strengths and weaknesses without building a final classifier.
