floor  and a dead prostitute in the bathroom  \\ni guess that if a movie had also gone really bad  there might be the same elements present  \\ncoincidence  \\npoor kyle  a meek looking jon favreau     he is about to marry his radiant fiancee  laura  cameron diaz   \\nbut before he exchanges his vows  he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout  \\nbut this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get  \\nthe prostitute has met a horrible  though accidental death  and drugs are everywhere  \\nthe five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time  \\na surprisingly calm robert boyd  christian slater   who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions  ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found  \\nalthough they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body  which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases   when they return from their trip  guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends  \\none is adam  daniel stern  he grows increasingly agitated  \\nwhenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way  his blood pressure increases  \\nor that just may be because of his dysfunctional family  \\nanother is michael  who was actually responsible for her death  \\nhe tries to bury his feelings  but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well  \\nboyd is the  doer of the group  \\nseemingly suffering from a long psychosis  when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed  he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks  \\nkyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations  \\nthen  theres moore  leland orser  who speaks  lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face  \\nthe problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy  but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny  \\ndrugs  mutilation  and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at  \\nas a straight psychological drama  i could see how it might have worked  as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways  \\nbut this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for  hours  \\nif you do like this movie  i dont think that i want to know you  \\ni did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the  smart play   \\nand diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee  \\nbut her talents are essentially wasted here  \\nits obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone  \\nbut the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless  \\ndo not make a very bad decision by seeing this film  \\n\",\n          \"with the abundance of trite  recycled movies in the late s  there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers  never mind movie critics  for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original  perhaps audaciously  perhaps purely thematically  \\nfor the former  you need look no further than director tom tykwers incredible german thriller run lola run  a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards  \\nlola  a contemporary gothgirl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day  \\nit seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks  and if he doesnt deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes  he will be killed  \\nthis gives lola twenty minutes to come up with    marks  or her boyfriend dies  \\nso she runs  not just jogs  sprints  in hopes that somehow  someway  shell be able to obtain the money and save a life  \\nfrom there  as critic steve rhodes described it  run lola run plays a bit like  sliding doors on steroids  \\nwith a nonstop techno soundtrack  wierd camerawork  all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace  anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something  \\nindeed  the movie is often outrageously exciting  as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious  \\nvery much like titanic  run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film  \\nthe way the movie is made  for pure visual style  tykwers movie is breathtaking  literally  sometimes   \\nthematically it does leave something to be desired  it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash  \\nwhile you are watching  this will not matter  \\nrunning a breezy  minutes  this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted  \\nit is the equivalent of a rollercoaster in the

through unreasonable obstacles to get girl  guy gets girl  \\nin rare cases  the genders are flipped  \\npredictability is a given  \\nrarely  though  is a romantic comedy as cheap  as obvious  or as pointless as serendipity  a film that uses its  theme  as an excuse for its plot contrivances  \\n  lightweight  doesnt begin to describe it  \\nthis is like antigravity  \\nit begins in a new york city bloomingdales  a product placement that rivals cast aways fedex for sheer blatancy  \\njonathan trager  john cusack  and sara thomas  kate beckinsale  both go for the same pair of gloves  \\nafter going through the perfunctory motions  jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream  followed by ice skating  \\njonathan falls hard  and sara is charmed  \\nwhen she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper  a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand  \\nshe takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldnt be together  jonathan is flabbergasted  \\nto pacify him  she comes up with an idea  jonathan will write his number on a  dollar bill  which she will promptly spend  \\nwhen she gets home  she will write her name and number inside a book   love in the time of cholera   and sell it to a used bookstore  \\nif the bill gets back to her or the book to him  it will mean that they are meant to be together  \\nthree years later  \\nboth sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests  \\nboth realize they arent content  \\nboth go looking for the other  \\nwhat happens now is so absurd that im almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it  \\nthe two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible  coincidences  that i would describe as contrivances if it werent for the film ohsocleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around  serendipity   \\nof course  since the movie is about fate  the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases  \\nim not buying it  \\ntheres no suspense in any of this because we know exactly whats going to happen  but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly  adorable  nonstory into our heads  \\ninstead of  will they meet   \\nthe question were asking is  when will they meet already   \\nto make matters worse  every  coincidence  is telegraphed from a mile away  by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else  incredible  was going to happen  \\ncusack is fine and beckinsale  at least  isnt saddled with another lumbering  clunky screenplay  shes had bad luck  what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume   just an inanely pointless one  \\nserendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy  who plays a snarky bloomingdales salesman  \\nwhats the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined  no pun intended  conclusion  \\nserendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings  but it only tests our patience
